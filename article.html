               <hr>
                <p>More than 450 million people suffer from mental disorders.  
                   According to WHO, by the year 2020, depression will constitute the second largest disease burden worldwide (Murray & Lopez, 1996).  Global burden of mental health will be well beyond the treatment capacities of developed and developing countries.  The social and economic costs associated with growing burden of mental ill health focused the possibilities for promoting mental health as well as preventing and treating mental illness.
                   Thus the Mental Health is linked to behaviour and seen as fundamental to physical health and quality of life.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Physical health and mental health are closely associated and it is proved beyond doubt that depression leads to heart and vascular diseases.</li>
                    <li>Mental disorders also affect persons health behaviour like eating sensibly, regular exercise, adequate sleep, engaging in safe sexual practices, alcohol and tobacco use, adhering to medical therapies thus increasing the risk of physical illness.</li>
                    <li>Mental ill health also leads to social problems like unemployment, broken families, poverty, drug abuse and related crime.</li>
                    <li>Poor mental health plays a significant role in diminished immune functioning.</li>
                    <li>Medically ill patients with depression have worse outcome than those without.</li>
                    <li>Chronic illnesses like diabetes, cancer, heart disease increases the risk of depression.</li>
                  </ul>

                <hr>
                <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
                    It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
                    It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. 
                    Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry.</li>
                    <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse.</li>
                    <li>Family history of mental health problems</li>

                <hr>
                <p>Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. 
                    Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
                </p>
                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>
                    Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of signs and symptoms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling sad or down</li>
                    <li>Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate</li>
                    <li>Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt</li>
                    <li>Extreme mood changes of highs and lows</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal from friends and activities</li>
                    <li>Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping</li>
                    <li>Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations</li>
                    <li>Inability to cope with daily problems or stress</li>
                    <li>Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people</li>
                    <li>Problems with alcohol or drug use</li>
                    <li>Major changes in eating habits</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, 
                    such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.

                  <hr>
                <p>
                    If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, 
                    see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems.
